# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops designed to
consider long-term issues and strategies for the Internet, and to suggest
future directions for the Internet architecture.  This long-term planning
function of the IAB is complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts
performed by working groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The Measuring Network Quality for End-Users workshop {{WORKSHOP}} was held
virtually by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in September 14-16, 2021.
This report summarizes the workshop, the topics discussed, and some preliminary
conclusions drawn at the end of the workshop.

## Problem space

The Internet in 2021 is quite different from what it was 10 years ago. Today, it
is a crucial part of everyoneâs daily life. People use the Internet for their
social life, for their daily jobs, for routine shopping, and for keeping up
with major events. An increasing number of people can access a Gigabit
connection, which would be hard to imagine a decade ago. And, thanks to
improvements in security, people trust the Internet for financial
banking transactions, purchasing goods and everyday bill payments.

At the same time, some aspects of end-user experience have not
improved as much.  Many users have typical connection latencies that
remain at decade-old levels.  Despite significant reliability
improvements in data center environments, end users also still often see
interruptions in service. Despite algorithmic advances in the field of
control theory, one still finds that the queuing delays in the
last-mile equipment exceeds the accumulated transit delays. Transport
improvements, such as QUIC, Multipath TCP, and TCP Fast Open are still
not fully supported in some networks.
<!-- I'm not sure there is agreement about this next sentence - Wes -->
Likewise, various advances in
the security and privacy of user data are not widely supported, such
as encrypted DNS to the local resolver.

Some of the major factors behind this lack of progress is the popular
perception that throughput is the often sole measure of the quality of
Internet connectivity. With such narrow focus, the Measuring Network
Quality for End-Users workshop aimed to discuss various questions:

- What is user latency under typical working conditions?
- How reliable is connectivity across longer time periods?
- Do networks allow the use of a broad range of protocols?
- What services can be run by network clients?
- What kind of IPv4, NAT, or IPv6 connectivity is offered, and are there
  firewalls?
- What security mechanisms are available for local services, such as DNS?
- To what degree are the privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity
  of user communications guarded?
- Improving these aspects of network quality will likely depend on
  measurement and exposing metrics in a meaningful way to all involved
  parties, including to end users. Such measurement and exposure of
  the right metrics will allow service providers and network operators
  to concentrate focus on their usersâ experience and will
  simultaneously empower users to choose the Internet service
  providers that can deliver the best experience based on their needs.
- What are the fundamental properties of a network that contributes to
  a good user experience?
- What metrics quantify these properties, and how can we collect such metrics in a
  practical way?
- What are the best practices for interpreting those metrics, and incorporating
  those in a decision making process?
- What are the best ways to communicate these properties to service providers
  and network operators?
- How can these metrics be displayed to users in a meaningful way?

# Workshop Agenda

# Workshop Topics and Discussion {#discussions}

The three day workshop was broken into four separate sections,
including introductory material, that each played a role in framing
the discussions. This was followed by a discussion about conclusions
that could be agreed upon by workshop participants ({{conclusions}}).

## Introduction and overviews

The workshop started with a broad focus on the state of user Quality
of Service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) the Internet today.
The goal of the introductory talks was to set the stage for the
workshop by describing both the problem space and the current
solutions in place and their limitations.

The introduction presentations by participants provided views of
existing QoS and QoE measurements and their effectiveness. Also
discussed was the interaction between multiple users within the
network, as well as the interaction between multiple layers of the OSI
stack.  Some existing measurement work was also presented.  Vint Cerf
provided a key note describing the history and importance of the
topic.

### Key points from the keynote by Vint Cerf {#dicsucssion-intro-keynote}

We may be operating in a networking space with dramatically different
parameters compared to 30 years ago. This differentiation justifies
re-considering not only the importance of one metric over the other,
but also re-considering the entire metaphor.

It is time for the experts to look at not only at adjusting TCP, but
also at exploring other protocols, such as QUIC and others as
well. It's important that we feel free to consider alternatives to
TCP. TCP is not a teddy bear, and one should not be afraid to replace
it with a transport later with better properties benefiting users.

A suggestion: we should consider desirable properties exercises. As we
are looking at the parametric spaces, one can identify âdesirable
propertiesâ, as opposed to âfundamental propertiesâ. Among such
properties, there may be a low-latency property. An example coming
from ARPA: you want to know where the missile is now, not where it
was. Understanding what is driving the particular parameter in the
design space.

When the parameter values are changed in extreme, such as
connectiveness, some other designs will emerge. One case study is the
interplanetary protocol, where "ping" is no long indicative of
anything useful. While we look at responsiveness, we should not ignore
connectivity.

Unfortunately, maintaining backward compatibility is painful. The work
on designing IPv6 so as to transition from IPv4 could have been done
better if the backward compatibility was considered. This is too late
for IPv6, but this problem space is not too late for the future laying
problems.

IPv6 is still not implemented fully everywhere.  Itâs been a long road
since starting work in 1996, and we are still not there. In 1996, the
thinking was that it was quite easy to implement IPv6, but that failed
to hold true. In 1996 the dot-com boom started and lots of money was
spent quickly, and the moment was not caught in time while the market
expanded exponentially. This should serve as a cautionary tale.

One last point: consider performance across multiple hops in the
Internet. Weâve not seen many end-to-end metrics, as successfully
developing end-to-end measurements across different network and
business boundaries is quite hard to achieve. A good question to ask
when developing new protocols is "will the new protocol work across
multiple network hops?"

Multi-hop networks are being gradually replaced by humongous flat
networks with sufficient connectivity between operators so that
systems become 1 hop or 2 hop at most away from each other
(e.g. Google, Facebook, Amazon). The fundamental architecture of the
Internet is changing.

### Introductory talks  {#discussion-introductions}

The Internet is a shared network, built on the IP protocols using
packet-switching to interconnect multiple autonomous networks. The
Internet's departure from circuit-switching technologies allowed it to
scale beyond any other known network. On the other hand, the lack of
in-network regulation made it difficult to ensure the best experience
for every user.

As the Internet use cases continue to expand, it becomes increasingly
more difficult to predict which network characteristics correlate with
better user experiences. Different application classes, e.g., video
streaming and teleconferencing, can affect user experience in complex,
and difficult to measure ways. Internet utilization shifts rapidly
during the course of each day, week and year, which further
complicates identifying key metrics capable of predicting a good user experience.

Quality of Service (QoS) initiatives attempted to overcome these
difficulties by strictly prioritizing different types of
traffic. However, QoS metrics do not always correlate with user
experience. The utility of the QoS metric is further limited by the difficulties in building solutions with the desired QoS characteristics.

Quality of Experience (( QoE)) initiatives attempted to integrate the
psychological aspects of how quality is perceived, and created
statistical models designed to optimize the user experience. Despite
these high modeling efforts, the QoE approach proved beneficial in
certain application classes. Unfortunately, generalizing the models
proved to be difficult, and the question of how different applications
affect each other when sharing the same network remains open.

The industry's focus on giving the end-user more throughput/bandwidth
led to remarkable advances. In many places around the world, a home
user enjoys gigabit speeds to their Internet Service Provider.  This
is so remarkable that it would have been brushed off as science
fiction a decade ago. However, the focus on increased capacity came at
the expense of neglecting the other important core metric: latency. As
a result, end-users whose experience is negatively affected by high
lateness were advised to upgrade their equipment to get more
throughput instead. {{MacMillian2021}} showed that sometimes such an upgrade can lead to latency improvements, due to the economical reasons of overselling the "value-priced" data plans.

As the industry continued to give the end user more throughput, while
neglecting the latency metric, application designs started to employ
various latency and short service disruption hiding techniques.  For
example, user experience of web browser performance is closely tired
to the content in the local cache. While such techniques can clearly
improve the user experience when using stale data is acceptable, this
development is further decoupling user experience from the core
metrics.

In the most recent 10 years, efforts by Dave Taht and the bufferbloat
society had led to significant progress updating queuing algorithms to
reduce latencies under load compared to simipler FIFO
queues. Unfortunately, the home router industry has yet to implement
these algorithms, mostly due to marketing and cost reasons. Most home
router manufacturers depend on System on a Chip (SoC) acceleration to
to make products with a desired throughput. The SoC manufacturers opt
for simpler algorithms and aggressive aggregation, reasoning that a
higher-throughput chip will have guaranteed demand. Because consumers
are offered choices primarily between different high throughput
devices, the perception that a higher throughput leads to higher a
quality of service continues to strengthen.

The home router is not the only place that can benefit from clearer
indications of acceptable performance for users. Since users perceive
the Internet via the lens of applications, its important to appeal to
the application vendors that they should adopt solutions that stress
lower latencies. Unfortunately, while bandwidth is straightforward to
measure, responsiveness is trickier. Many applications have found a
set of metrics which are helpful to their realm, but these are not
generalizable and universally applicable. Furthermore, due to the
highly competitive application space, vendors may have economic
reasons to avoid sharing their most useful metrics.

<!-- incomplete: suggest we leave it out
Finally, the Internet infrastructure that connects the applictions to the users is yet another place where better measurements may help driving towards the better Internet.

### Introductory talks - key points  {#discussion-introductions-summary}

1. Measuring bandwidth is necessary, but is not alone sufficient.
2. In many cases, Internet users donât need more bandwidth, but rather
   need "better bandwidth" -- i.e., they need other connectivity improvements.
3. The users perceive the quality of their Internet connection based
   on the applications they use, which are affected by a combination
   of factors. There's little value in exposing a typical user to the
   entire spectrum of possible reasons for the poor performance
   perceived in their application-centric view.
4. Many factors affecting user experience are outside the users'
   sphere of control. It's unclear whether exposing the users to these
   other factors will help user's understand their performance
   state. In general, users prefer simple, categorical choices
   (e.g. "good", "better", and "best" options).
5. The Internet content market is highly competitive, and many
   applications develop their own "secret sauce."

## Metrics considerations {#discussion-metrics}

The workshop continued to discuss various metrics that can be used
instead of or in addition to available bandwidth. Several workshop
attendees presented deep-dive studies on measurement methodology.

### Common performance metrics

Losing Internet access is, of course, the worst user
experience. Unfortunately, unless rebooting the home router restores
connectivity, there is little a user can do other than contacting
their service provider. Nevertheless, there is value in the systematic
collection of availability metrics on the client side: these can help
the user's ISP localize and resolve issues faster, while enabling
users to better choose between ISPs. One can measure the availability
directly by simply attempting connections from the client-side to
locations of interest. For example, {{tools.ookla_speedtest}} uses a
large number of Android devices to measure network and cellular
availability around the globe. Ookla collects hundreds of millions of
data points per day, and uses these for accurate availability
reporting. An alternative approach is to derive availability from the
failure rates of other tests. For example, {{FCC_MBA}} uses thousands
of off-the shelf routers, called "Whiteboxes", with measurement
software developed by {{tools.samknows}}. These Whiteboxes perform an
array of network tests and report availability based whether test
connections were successful or not.

Measuring available capacity can be helpful to the end-users, but it
is even more valuable for service providers and application
developers. High-definition video streaming requires significantly
more capacity than any other type of traffic. At the time of the
workshop, video traffic constituted 90% of overall Internet traffic
and contributed to 95% of the revenues from monetization (via
subscriptions, fees, or ads). As a result, video streaming services,
such as Netflix, need to continuously cope with rapid changes in the
available capacity. The ability to measure available capacity in
real-time allows leveraging the different adaptive bitrate (ABR)
compression algorithms to ensure the best possible user
experience. Measuring the aggregated capacity demand allows Internet
Service Provider's to be ready for traffic spikes. For example, during
the end-of-year holiday season, the global demand for capacity has
been shown to be 5-7 times higher than other seasons.  For end-users,
knowledge of their capacity needs can help them choose a data plan
best suited for them. In many cases, however, end-users have more than
enough capacity, and adding more bandwidth will not improve their
experience as after a point it is no longer the limiting factor in
user experience. Finally, the ability to differentiate between the
"throughput" and the "goodput" can be helpful in identifying when the
network is saturated.

In measuring network quality, latency is the time that it takes a
network packet to traverse the path from one end to the other through
the network. At the time of this report, users in many places
worldwide can enjoy Internet access that has adequately high capacity
and availability for their current needs. For these users, latency
improvements, rather than bandwidth improvements, can lead to the most
significant improvements in the quality of experience. The established
latency metric is a round-trip time (RTT), commonly measured in
milliseconds. However, users often find the RTT unintuitive since,
unlike other performance metrics, high RTT values indicate poor
latency. {{Paasch2021}} and {{Mathis2021}} presented an inverse
metric, called "Round-trips per minute" (RPM).

There is an essential distinction between the "idle latency" and
"latency under working conditions." The former is measured when the
network is not used and reflects the best-case scenario. The latter is
measured when the network is under a typical workload. Until recently,
the typical case was to present the idle latency. However, these
numbers can be misleading. For example, data presented at the workshop
shows that the idle latency can be up to 25 times lower than the
latency under typical working conditions. Because of that, when
presenting latency to the end-user, it is essential to make a clear
distinction between the two.

Data shows that rapid changes in capacity affect
latency. {{Foulkes2021}} attempts to quantify how often a rapid change
in capacity can cause connectivity to become "unstable", i.e., having
high latency but very little throughput. Such changes in capacity can
be caused by infrastructure failures, but are much more often caused
by in-network phenomena, such changing traffic engineering
policies, or rapid changes in cross-traffic.

Data presented at the workshop shows that 36% of measured lines have
capacity metrics that vary by more than 10% throughout the day and
across multiple days. These differences are caused by many variables,
including local connectivity methods (WiFi vs. Ethernet), competing
LAN traffic, device load/configuration, time of day and local
loop/backhaul capacity. These factors make measuring capacity only
using an end-user device or network difficult. A network router that
sees aggregated traffic from multiple devices provides a better
vantage point for capacity measurements. Such a test can account for
the totality of local traffic and perform an independent capacity
test. And even then, various factors might limit the accuracy of said
test. Accurate capacity measurement requires a multiple samples.

As users perceive the Internet through the lens of applications, it
may be difficult to correlate changes in capacity and latency with the
quality of the end-user experience. For example, web browsers rely on
cached page versions to shorten page load times and mitigate
connectivity losses. In addition, social networking applications often
rely on pre-fetching their "feed" items. These techniques make the
core in-network metrics less indicative of the users' experience and
necessitates collecting data in-application.

It is helpful to distinguish between applications that operate on a
"fixed latency budget" from those that have more tolerance to latency
variance. Cloud gaming serves as an example application that requires
a "fixed latency budget", as a sudden latency spike can decide the
"win/lose" ratio for a player. Companies that compete in the lucrative
cloud gaming market make significant infrastructure investments, such
as buiding entire datacenters closer to their users. These data
centers highlight the economic benefits that having fewer latency
spikes outweigh the associated deployment cost. On the other hand,
applications that are more tolerant to latency spikes can sometimes
operate reasonably well through short spikes. Yet even those
applications can benefit from consistently low latency. For example,
Video-on-Demand (VOD) apps can work reasonably well when the video is
consumed linearly, but once the user tries to "switch a channel", or
to "skip ahead", the user experience suffers unless the latency
is sufficiently low.

Finally, as the applications continue to evolve, in-application
metrics are gaining in importance. Using VOD as an example, one
can assess the quality of experience by checking whether the video
player can use the highest possible resolution, whether the video is
smooth or freezing, and other similar metrics. Then, the application
developer can effectively use these metrics to prioritize future
work. All popular video platforms (Youtube, Instagram, Netflix, and
others) have developed frameworks to collect and analyze such metrics at
scale. One example is the Scuba framework used by Meta {{FB_Scuba}}.

Unfortunately, the in-application metrics can be challenging to use
for comparative research purposes. Firstly, different applications
often use different metrics to measure the same phenomena. For
example, application A can measure the smoothness of video via "mean
time to re-buffer." In contrast, application B can rely on the
"probability of re-buffering per second" for the same purpose. A
different challenge with using in-application metrics is that at the
time of the workshop, VOD is a significant source of revenue for
companies such as YouTube, Facebook, and Netflix, which places
proprietary incentives against exchanging the in-application
data. Finally, in-application metrics can also accurately describe the
activities and preferences of an individual end-user, leading to
privacy infringements.

### Measurement case studies

{{Paasch2021}} introduced a methodology for measuring working latency
from the end-user vantage point. The suggested method incrementally
adds network flows between the user device and a server endpoint until
a bottleneck capacity is reached. From these measurements, a round
trip latency is measured and reported to the end-user. The authors
chose to report results with the RPM metric. The methodology had been
implemented in Apple Monterey OS.

{{Mathis2021}} have applied the RPM metric to the results of more than
4 billion download tests that M-Lab performed in 2010-2021. During
this time frame, the M-Lab measurement platform underwent several
upgrades which allowed the research team to compare the effect of
different TCP congestion control algorithms (CCAs) on the measured
end-to-end latency. The study showed that the use Cubic CCA leads to
increased working latency, which is attributed to its use of larger
queues.

{{Schlinker2019}} presented a large-scale study that aimed to
establish a correlation between goodput and quality of experience on a
large social network. The authors performed the measurements at
multiple data centers from which video segments of set sizes were
streamed to a large number of end users. The authors used the goodput
and throughput metrics to determine whether particular paths were
congested.

{{Reed2021}} presented the analysis of working latency measurements
collected as part of the FCC's "Measuring Broadband America" (MBA)
program. The FCC does not include working latency in its yearly report,
but does offer it in the raw data files. The authors used a
subset of the raw data to identify important differences in the
working latencies across different ISPs.

{{MacMillian2021}} presented analysis of working latency across
multiple service tiers. They found that, unsurprisingly, "premium"
tier users experienced lower working latency compared to a "value"
tier. The data demonstrated that working latency varies significantly
within each tier; one possible explanation is the difference in
equipment deployed in the homes.

These studies have stressed the importance of measurement of the
working latency. At the time of this report, many home router
manufacturers relied on hardware-accelerated routing which used FIFO
queues. Focusing the working latency measurements on those devices,
and making the consumer aware of the effect of chosing one
manufacturer vs. other can help improving the home router
situation. The ideal test would be able to identify the working
latency, and to pinpoint to the source of delay (home router, ISP,
server side, or some network node in between).

Another source of high working latency comes from network routers that
are exposed to cross-traffic. As {{Schlinker2019}} indicated, these
can become saturated during the peak hours of the day. Systematic
testing of the working latency in routers under load can help improve
the infrastructure.

### Metrics Key Points {#discussions-metrics-key-points}

1. Availability and capacity are "hygienic factors" - unless an
   application is capable of using extra capacity, end-users will see
   little benefit from using overprovisioned lines.
3. The working latency has stronger correlation with user experience
   than latency under an idle network load. The working latency can
   exceed the idle latency by order of magnitude.
4. The RPM metric is a stable metric, with positive values being
   better, that can be effective to communicate latency to the
   end-users.
5. The relationship between throughput and goodput can be effective in
   finding the saturation points, both in client-side {{Paasch2021}}
   and server-side {{Schlinker2019}} settings.
6. Working latency depends on algorithm choice for addressing endpoint
   congestion control and router queuing.

## Cross-layer Considerations {#discussions-cross-layer}

In the Cross-layer section participants presented material and discussed
how accurately measuring exactly where problems occur is difficult
when many components of a network connection can affect the
measurement.  Discussion centered especially on the differences
between physically wired and wireless connections and the difficulties
of accurately determining problem spots when multiple different
network types are responsible for the quality.


he participants have agreed that no single component of a network connection
has all the data to be able to measure the effects of the network performance
on the quality of the end user experience.

- The applications that are running on the end-user devices have the best
  insight into their respective performance, but have limited visibility into
  the behavior of the network, and are not able to act on the limited information
  about the network performance.
- The Internet service providers have good insight into the QoS considerations,
  but are not able to infer the effect of the QoS metrics on the quality of the
  end user experience.
- The content providers have good insight into the aggregated behavior of the
  end users, but lack the insight on what aspects of the network performance
  are the leading indicators of the users behavior.

The workshop had identified the need for a standard and extensible way to
exchange the network performance. Such exchnage standard should address the
folowing aspects:

- Scalable way to capture the performance of multiple (potentially thousandsof) endpoints.
- Accompanying set of tools to analyze the data.
- A transparent model for giving the different actors on the network connection
  an incentive to share the performance data they collect.
- Prservation of the privacy of the end users. In particular, federated
  learning approaches, where no centralized entity has the access to the whole
  picture, are preferred.
- The data exchange format should include precautions against data
  manipulations, so that the different actors won't be tempted to game the
  mechanism.

### Separation of Concerns

Commonly, there's a tight coupling between 
a. collecting performance metrics,
b. interpreteting those metrics and 
c. acting upon the intrepretation of the metrics.

Unfortunately, such model is not the best for achieving exchange of the
cross-layer data:
- The actors that have the ability to collect particular performance metrics
  (e.g. the TCP RTT) do not necessarily have the context necessary for a
  meaningful interpretation.
- The actors that have the context and the computational/storage capacity for
  the interpretation do not necessarily have the abilty to control the behavior
  of network / application.
- The actors that can control the behavior of network / application typically
  do not have access to the data. 

The participatns have agreed that it is important to separate the above three
aspects, so that:
- The different actors that have the data but not the ability to interpret /
  act upon will be able to publish the measured data
- The actors that have the expertise in interpreting and synthesizing the
  performanace data will be able to publish the results of the interpetation /
  synthesis
- The actors that act upon the interpretation are 

### Security and Privacy Considerations

Preserving the privacy of the end users is a difficult requirement to
meet when addressing this problem space. There is an intrinsic
trade-off between collecting more data about user activities, and
infringing their privacy in doing so.


### Concrete Suggestions

- The TCP protocol makes several metrics available for the passive measurement,
  and the following metrics were found effective:
  - TCP connection latency using SACK/ACK measurements, as well as the timing
    between the TCP retransmission events, are good proxies for the end-to-end
    RTT.
  - On Linux platform, the tcp_info structure is the de-facto standard for the
    application to introspect the performance of kernel-space networking. There
    is no equivalent de-facto standard for the user-space networking.
- The QUIC/MASQUE protocols make passive performance measurment more difficult.
  For these protocols, an approach that uses federated measurement /
  hierarchical aggregation appears more valuable. 
  - The QLOG format seems to be the most mature candidate for souch exchange.


Security, privacy and data protections considerations make the
cross-layer The participants agreed that observability across multiple
layers is necessary for measurement of the network quality.



The presentation by {{Kerpez2021}} showed that as Internet access
becomes the norm, the limited bandwidth of 2.4Ghz wifi is most
frequently the bottleneck. In comparison, the wider bandwidth of the
5Ghz WiFi have only been the bottleneck in 20% of the observations.

### Towards Future Cross-layer Observability {#discussions-cross-observability}

The ownership of the Internet is spread across multiple administrative domains, making access to performance data difficult. Furthermore, the immense scale of the Internet makes aggregation and analysis of such data difficult. {{Marx2021}}  presented a simple logging format that could potentially be used to collect and aggregate data from different layers.

The other aspect of cross-layer collaboration is that majority of current alogrithms do not explicitly provide performance data that can be part of a cross-layer analysis. The IETF community can be more diligent in identifying the key performance indicators, and exposing those as part of the protocol specification.

Despite all the challenges, it should still be possible to perform limited-scope studies to have a better understanding of how user quality is affected by the interaction of the different components that constitute the Internet. Recent development of federated learning algorithms suggests that it might be possible to perform cross-layer performance measurements while preserving the privacy of the users.

On the server side, the `tcp_info` structure can be decorated with performance information from other layers to give richer data set.

### Efficient Collaboration Between Hardware and Transport Protocols {#discussions-cross-layer-hw-tp}

With the advent of the L4S congestion notification and control, there's even higher need for the transport protocols and the underlying hardware to work in unison.

At the time of the workshop, the typical home router used a single FIFO queue, large enough to allow amortizing the lower-layer header overhead across multiple transport PDUs. These designs worked well with the Cubic congestion control algorithm, yet the newer generation of CCAs can operate on much smaller queues. To fully support <1ms latency, the home router needs to work efficiently on sequential transmissions of just a few segments, vs. being optimized for large packet bursts.

Another design trait that's common in the home routers is use of packet aggregation, to further amortize the overhead added by the lower-layer headers. Multiple IP datagrams are combined into a single large tranfer frame. This aggregation can add up to 10ms to the packet sojourn delay.

Following the famous "you can't improve what you don't measure" adage, it is important to expose these aggregation delays in a way that would allow identifying the bottlenecks, and making the hardware more suitable for the next generation transport protocols.

### Cross-Layer Key Points {#cross-layer-keypoints}

TBD

## Synthesis

Finally, in the Synthesis section presentations and discussions
concentrated on the next steps likely needed to make forward
progress. Of particular concern is how to bring forward measurements
that can make sense to end users trying to make subscription
decisions.


### Synthesis Key Points

# Conclusions {#conclusions}

During the final hour of the workshop we gathered statements that the
group thought were summary statements from the 3 day event.  We later
discarded any that were in contention (listed further below for
completeness).  For this document, the editor took the original list
and divided it into rough categories, applied some suggested edits
discussed on the mailing list and further edited for clarity and to
provide context.

## General statements

1. Bandwidth is necessary but not alone sufficient.
2. In many cases, Internet users donât need more bandwidth, but rather
   need "better bandwidth" -- i.e., they need other improvements to
   their connectivity.
3. We need both active and passive measurements â passive measurements
   can provide historical debugging.
4. We need passive measurements to be continuous and archivable and
   queriable â include reliability/connectivity measurements.
5. A really meaningful metric for users is whether their application
   will work properly or fail because of a lack of a network with
   sufficient characteristics.
6. A useful metric for goodness must actually incentive goodness --
   good metrics should be actionable to help drive industries toward
   improvement.
7. A lower latency Internet, however achieved would benefit all end
   users.

## Specific statements about detailed protocols/techniques

8. Round trips Per Minute (RPM) is a useful, consumable metric.
9. We need a usable tool that fills the current gap between network
   reachability, latency, and speed tests.
10. End-users that want to be involved in QoS decisions should be able
    to voice their needs and desires.
11. Applications are needed that can perform and report good quality
    measurements in order to identify insufficient points in
    network access.
12. Research done by regulators indicate that users/consumers prefer
    a simple metric per application, which frequently resolves to
    whether the application will work properly or not.
13. New measurements and QoS or QoE techniques should not rely only or
    depend on reading TCP headers.
10. It is clear from developers of interactive applications and from
    network operators that lower latency is a strong factor in user
    QoE.  However, metrics are lacking to support this statement
    directly.

## Problem statements and concerns

15. Latency mean and medians are distractions from better measurements.
16. It is frustrating to only measure network services without
    simultaneously improving those services.
17. Stakeholder incentives arenât aligned for easy wins in this space.
    Incentives are needed to motivate improvements in public network
    access.  Measurements may be one step toward driving competitive
    market incentive.
18. For future-proof networking, it is important to measure the
    ecological impact of material and energy usage.
19. We do not have incontrovertible evidence that any one metric
    (e.g., latency or speed) is more important than others to persuade
    device vendors to concentrate on any one optimization.

## No-consensus reached statements

Additional statements were recorded that did not have consensus of the
group at the time, but we list them here for completeness about the fact
they were discussed:

1. We do not have incontrovertible evidence that buffer bloat is a
   prevalent problem.
2. The measurement needs to support reporting localization in order to
   find problems.  Specifically:
    - Detecting a problem is not sufficient if you canât find the location.
    - Need more than just English â different localization concerns.
3. Stakeholder incentives arenât aligned for easy wins in this space.

# Follow-on work

There was discussion during the workshop about where future work
should be performed.  The group agreed that some work could be done
more immediately within existing IETF working groups (e.g. IPPM,
DetNet and RAW), while other longer-term research may be needed in
IRTF groups.

# Security considerations

A few security relevant topics were discussed at the workshop,
including but not limited to:

- What prioritization techniques can work without invading the privacy
  of the communicating parties.
- How oversubscribed networks can essentially be viewed as a DDoS
  attack.
